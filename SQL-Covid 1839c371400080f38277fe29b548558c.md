# SQL-Covid

This analysis focuses on using SQL to explore insights into the Covid cases and vaccinations in New Zealand and around the world. The datasets were acquired from Our World in Data database [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The two datasets used were CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. 

For this project online SQL editor [https://sqliteonline.com/](https://sqliteonline.com/) was used to import the datasets as CSV files. Data cleaning was not needed as the datasets were comprehensive. 

The project utilises all sorts of SQL queries to gain deep insights about the data.
