# SQL-Covid

This analysis focuses on using SQL to explore insights into the Covid cases and vaccinations in New Zealand and around the world. The datasets were acquired from Our World in Data database [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The two datasets used were ***CovidDeaths*** and ***CovidVaccinations***. 

For this project online SQL editor [https://sqliteonline.com/](https://sqliteonline.com/) was used to import the datasets as CSV files. Data cleaning was not needed as the datasets were comprehensive. 

The project utilises all sorts of SQL queries to gain deep insights about the data. 

```sql
-- total cases vs total deaths --
SELECT 
    location, 
    date,
    population, 
    total_cases, 
    total_deaths, 
    (total_deaths * 1.0 / total_cases) * 100 AS Deathpercent
FROM 
    Deaths
WHERE 
    location = 'New Zealand' and continent is not null
ORDER BY Deathpercent DESC;
```

NZ saw an upward death rate from Covid from May to August 2020. 

```sql
-- Total cases vs population
-- estimate liklihood of dying if COVID spreads in NZ
SELECT 
    location, 
    population, 
    date, 
    total_cases, 
    total_deaths, 
    (total_deaths * 1.0 / population) * 100 AS Deathpercent
FROM 
    Deaths
WHERE 
    location = 'New Zealand'
ORDER by Deathpercent DESC;
```

The death percent per population was high from Feb 2021 to April 2021. 

```sql
--Countries with highest infection rates compared to populationDeaths

SELECT 
    location, 
    population, 
    MAX(total_cases * 1.0) as Highest_infection_count,  
    total_deaths, 
    MAX((total_deaths * 1.0 / total_cases)) * 100 AS Precent_population_infected
FROM 
    Deaths
Group by location, population
ORDER by Precent_population_infected desc;
```

Top 3 countries with highest infected population were Guyana, Iran, and Sudan. This can be due the fact that the healthcare infrastructure is not well established in these countries. 

Top 3 countries with lowest infected population were Bhutan, Timor and Mongolia. These countries have some of the lowest populations in the world, therefore the rate of infection is low. 

```sql
--Countries with highest death counts per populationDeaths

SELECT 
    location, 
    MAX(CAST(total_deaths as integer)) as Total_death_count
FROM Deaths
Where continent != ''
Group by location
ORDER by Total_death_count desc;
```

Countries with highest death counts were United States, Brazil, Mexico, India and United Kingdom. 

```sql
-- Continents with highest death counts

SELECT 
    continent,
    MAX(CAST(total_deaths as integer)) as Total_death_count
FROM 
	Deaths
WHERE 
	continent is not NULL
GROUP by 
	continent
order by Total_death_count desc;
```

Top 3 continents with highest death counts per population were North America, South America and Asia. 

```sql
-- overall total cases and deaths percentage

SELECT 
	sum(new_cases * 1.0) as totalcases, 
    sum(new_deaths * 1.0) as totaldeaths, 
    sum(new_deaths * 1.0)/ sum(new_cases * 1.0)*100 as deathpercentage
from 
	Deaths
where 
    continent is not null
```

Overall, global death percentage was 2.13 

```sql
-- cases and deaths per month global
SELECT 
 	STRFTIME('%Y-%m', date) AS month, 
 	SUM(total_cases) AS total_cases, 
    SUM(total_deaths) AS total_deaths 
FROM Deaths 
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY total_deaths DESC;
```

The highest total deaths globally were in the month of April, March and February of 2021. 

```sql
-- cases and deaths per month - New Zealand
SELECT 
	--location,
 	STRFTIME('%Y-%m', date) AS month, 
 	SUM(total_cases) AS total_cases, 
    SUM(total_deaths) AS total_deaths 
FROM Deaths 
--where location = 'New Zealand'
GROUP BY month

```

A similar trend can be observed in NZ too, highest number of total deaths were witnessed in the month of March, April and January of 2021. 

```sql
--total population vs vaccinations in New Zealand (cumulative vaccinations)

SELECT Deaths.continent, Deaths.location, Deaths.date, population, Vaccinations.new_vaccinations, 
	sum(Vaccinations.new_vaccinations) OVER (Partition BY Deaths.location ORDER by Deaths.date) AS cumulative_vaccination 
from Deaths
join Vaccinations on Deaths.location = Vaccinations.location and Deaths.date = Vaccinations.date
where Deaths.continent != '' and Deaths.location = 'New Zealand'
order by 1,2,3; 
```

![Screenshot 2025-01-24 at 2.06.41 PM.png](SQL-Covid%201839c371400080f38277fe29b548558c/Screenshot_2025-01-24_at_2.06.41_PM.png)

The vaccinations in NZ started from 19th of Feb, 2021. The cumulative_vaccination column adds up everyday vaccination as cumulative vaccinations in New Zealand i.e. the everyday vaccination numbers are added to show total vaccinations. 

```sql
-- Using CTE to show population VS vaccinationsDeaths

WITH PopvsVacc (continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, cumulative_vaccination) AS 
(
 SELECT 
  Deaths.continent, Deaths.location, Deaths.date, Deaths.population, 
  Vaccinations.new_vaccinations, SUM(Vaccinations.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY Deaths.location ORDER BY Deaths.date) AS cumulative_vaccination
    FROM 
        Deaths
    JOIN 
        Vaccinations 
    ON 
        Deaths.location = Vaccinations.location 
        AND Deaths.date = Vaccinations.date
    WHERE 
        Deaths.continent != ''
)
SELECT 
    continent, 
    location, 
    date, 
    population, 
    new_vaccinations, 
    cumulative_vaccination
FROM PopvsVacc
ORDER BY location, date;
```
